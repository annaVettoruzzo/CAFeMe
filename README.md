# **CAFeMe**

Code for the paper **Personalized Federated Learning with Contextual Modulation and Meta-Learning (2023)**.

In this paper we propose *CAFeMe*, a context-aware federated learning solution that leverages meta-learning to facilitate personalization to each client.

# Data:
- RMNIST with shards and Dirichlet partition
- CIFAR-10 with shards and Dirichlet partition
- FEMNIST
- Meta-Dataset

# Usage
